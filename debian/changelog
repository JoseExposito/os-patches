xdg-dbus-proxy (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/upstream/metadata: Add DEP-12 metadata
  * New upstream release
    - Drop all patches, applied upstream
  * Remove workaround that made sure build-aux/tap-test was executable.
    Now that it's part of the upstream source and not added by a patch,
    it already has suitable permissions.

xdg-dbus-proxy (0.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release under this name (Closes: #915579).
    xdg-dbus-proxy was previously flatpak-dbus-proxy, in the flatpak
    package. It was factored out by the Flatpak upstream developers so
    that it can be used by packages like webkit2gtk 2.23.x.
  * Apply patches from upstream git to add a license, --help, a man page
    and a simple regression test (upstream PRs #2, #3, #5) and to
    fix a compiler warning (upstream PR #4)
