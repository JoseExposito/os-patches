  <name>AppStream Generator</name>
  <summary>A fast AppStream metadata generator</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      AppStream is a cross-distribution specification to provide metadata about software components.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appstream-generator tool generates AppStream metadata from the repositories of a software distribution.
      It currently supports the following repository formats / distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, RPM-MD (Fedora, Mageia).
    </p>
    <p>
      The generator will produce AppStream collection metadata files in the AppStream YAML or XML format to be shipped
      to users, as well as a detailed HTML report about found components and HTML and JSON reports on issues detected
      with the scanned metadata. It reads .desktop files as well as metainfo files, renders fonts, scales images, caches
      screenshots etc. to produce high-quality metadata for AppStream based software centers to consume.
      Usually, appstream-generator is integrated with the existing software build &amp; delivery workflow of
      a distribution.
